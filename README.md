# Project Objective
Predict loan outcome status of a loan for Lending Club. Machine Learning models were trained using the Lending Club 2016 Quarter 1 data and 2016 Quarter 2 data was used as test dataset. 

# LendingClub

Lending club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform which uses technology to create a credit
marketplace at a lower cost than traditional bank loan programs. By connecting borrowers and investors
directly and allowing them to invest in and borrow from each other, it avoids the cost and complexity of
the banking system and passes the savings on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and to investors
in the form of solid returns. The entire process is online and relies on technology to promote affordability
of the credit over availability of the credit.

# How does Lending Club works?
1. Customers interested in a loan complete a simple application at LendingClub.com
2. Lending Club leverage online data and technology to quickly assess risk, determine a credit rating and assign appropriate interest rates. Qualified applicants receive offers in just minutes and can evaluate loan options with no impact to their credit score
3. Investors ranging from individuals to institutions select loans in which to invest and can earn monthly returns
